A personal iOS application designed and developed individually to explore modern SwiftUI practices with Firebase integration. The project follows a clean modular structure with Core (Models, Repositories, Services, Utils), Features (Auth, Dashboard, Habits, Mood, Routines, Profile, Settings), and Shared components. It supports mood and habit tracking, routine management, and profile customization. Firebase Authentication and Firestore provide secure, real-time data persistence, while NotificationService, Haptics, and custom UI components enhance the user experience. The project also includes widgets (SolunaWidgets target) and Siri Intents for quick logging. Overall, Soluna demonstrates end-to-end mobile development with modern SwiftUI patterns, DIContainer setup, and reactive state management.
